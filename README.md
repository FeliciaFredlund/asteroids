## Virtual Environment Info
Always make sure the virtual environment was running while starting the game or submitting tests.
(venv) Should be before my terminal prompts.

Use this command to start it:
source venv/bin/activate

## The way I figured out how to do it vs what was simplier

How I did it:
`pygame.Surface.fill(screen, (0, 0, 0))`

How it is easier to do a black screen with pygame:
`screen.fill("black")`
